# inField API

Welcome to [inField](https://www.getinfield.app
)'s backend API!

## Project

The original intention of inField's product was to identify various species of pests which can be dangerous to crops in Canada and Africa using visual recognition.

The founders eventually decided to change the service to connect agronomists with farmers through chat and video. This enabled farmers to seek expert advice without the need for an agronomist to be in the same physical location.

The backend is built using <strong>Node.js, MongoDB, Stripe, Twilio and Passport.js</strong>. Hosting was handled using <strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong>.

### Note

This API contains the basic backend structure for this application. I ceased to work on it once the founders decided to shut down the company, which is why certain functionalities are not complete.
